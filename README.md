Assumptions
Data Structures
Departments File
Spec doesn't say whether the department ID is just a sequential number or whether the numbers have significance to the department name and should be user defined. In this case I have made the assuption that it is just a sequence and its value has no meaning.

Employees File
Spec doesn't say whether the employee ID is just a sequential number or whether the numbers have significance to the department name and should be user defined. In this case I have made the assuption that they should be user defined.
Have made the assumption both salepersons report to Jimmy Willis, manager id is null in the source data.
